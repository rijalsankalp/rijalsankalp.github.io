      <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        <p>
          I am currently a graduate student in Computer Science at Villanova
          University, pursuing my master&apos;s degree with a focus on AI/ML and
          software development. I also work as a Graduate Assistant in the
          Department of Computing Sciences. My experience includes research and
          model development in NLP, where I have designed, developed, and
          deployed ETL pipelines for large-scale multilingual data, as well as
          reproduced and experimented with various machine learning models, NLP
          tools, and small language models.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I have worked on web development projects using front-end
          technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also have experience
          in database design â€” from requirement analysis and ER diagram creation
          to implementing relational schemas and developing application code to
          interact with the database.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy tackling challenges in language processing and analysis. My
          work spans building and deploying machine learning models to designing
          complete web applications that support those systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond technical skills, I value collaboration, continuous learning,
          and effective communication. I am actively seeking opportunities where
          I can apply my knowledge, grow professionally, and contribute to
          meaningful projects that make a positive impact.
        </p>
